### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```HTML
<section class="home">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="logo">
      <img src="assets/images/logo.svg" loading="lazy" alt="Logo" />
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="title-container">
        <h1>A history of everything you copy</h1>
        <p>
          Clipboard allows you to track and organize everything you copy.
          Instantly access your clipboard on all your devices.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="buttons">
        <button class="success">Download for iOS</button>
        <button class="primary">Download for Mac</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```
```css
body main .about .hero {
  margin-top: 80px;
}
body main .about .hero-image {
  max-width: 100%;
}
body main .about .hero-content {
  margin-top: 50px;
}
body main .about .hero-content .item {
  text-align: center;
  width: 80%;
  margin: auto;
}
body main .about .hero-content .item:not(:last-child) {
  margin-bottom: 50px;
}
```

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me for css properties. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [StackOverFlow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to improve the performance and accessability. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
